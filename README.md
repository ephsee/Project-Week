On this single page web app, built using JavaScript and the React 17 library, a user should be able to do the following:

-Access a number of scientific resources related to a daily protocol of gratitude practices shown in double blind peer reviewed studies to produce a serotonergic boost.
-Read narrative stories about people being helped or mentored by others. These narrative stories can be thought about at future times when a user may sense a need to boost a feeling of connection, wellbeing, contentment, or peace.
-Share their own story of being mentored or helped. User will share their name, the name of their mentor/helper, their story, an image URL of their mentor, as well as a thank you note.
-Click to view a random fact about gratitude.
-Learn about the Huberman Lab, a podcast and youtube channel avaiable at no cost to consumer, which shares weekly insights into optimizing health and wellbeing through protocols developed based upon results from peer reviewed double blind studies coming from the Apex scientific journals.

The site has a main navigation which has home, about, resources, and stories links.
